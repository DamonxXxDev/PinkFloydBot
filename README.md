# Pink Floyd Bot

This is fairly simple Discord bot that does a bunch of cool things like lyrics trivia and lyrics lookup (more features to be added soon). You could also casually talk with the bot about anything. 



###Commands:###

The main delimeter for talking with the bot is `]]`. Alternativley, you could use `]]]` to trigger the smart replies.

* `]]help`: Sends a PM containing a list of all the commands and what they do.

* `]]lyrics`: Starts the lyrics trivia game.

* `]]lyrics song Name`: Displays the lyrics of the specified song. ie: `]]lyrics echoes`

* `]]]whatever`: Triggers the smart bot. ie: `]]] whats up? ` *Credit goes to the [Acobot] (http://acobot.net/) team.*
